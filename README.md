# ðŸŽ¯ Barrel Hit Mini Game (First UE5 Project)

This is a simple mini-game made in *Unreal Engine 5* where the player throws balls at barrels to earn points. It was created as my *first UE5 project* to learn core gameplay systems like Blueprint scripting, collisions, and UI.

## ðŸ•¹ Gameplay
- Throw a ball at a barrel.
- If the barrel is hit:
  - A sound plays at the collision location.
  - The player earns *+10 points*.
- The player has a *limited number of balls* to use.

## ðŸ§  Features Implemented
- Physics-based ball throwing
- Collision detection between ball and barrel
- Sound effect on successful hit
- Score system (10 points per hit)
- Ammo system with limited throws
- Simple UI for score and ammo

## ðŸ“¦ Tools Used
- Unreal Engine 5.5
- Blueprint Visual Scripting

## ðŸŽ“ What I Learned
- Using Blueprints to control gameplay logic
- Playing sound at a specific location
- Creating and updating UI widgets
- Managing game state variables (ammo, score)

This is my *first Unreal Engine project*, and it helped me understand how to build an interactive game from scratch. I plan to build on this experience with more advanced projects in the future.
